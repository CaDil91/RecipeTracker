## üöÄ Next Sprint: User Management & Authentication

**Sprint 4** will add user authentication and data isolation. See [`docs/sprint-4.md`](./docs/sprint-4.md) for details:
- User registration and login
- JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- User-scoped recipe data
- Password reset flow
- Email verification (optional)

## Architecture

### Application Flow
1. **server.ts**: Entry point - validates environment, configures logger, starts Express
2. **app.ts**: Configures middleware stack, routes, and error handling
3. **config/environment.ts**: Zod-validated environment variables with type safety

### Middleware Stack (Order Critical)
1. **helmet**: Security headers
2. **cors**: Cross-origin handling (before routes)
3. **morgan**: HTTP request logging (logs to Winston)
4. **compression**: Response compression
5. **body-parser**: JSON/URL-encoded parsing (10mb limit)
6. **swagger-ui**: API documentation at `/api-docs`
7. **routes**: Application routes
8. **error handler**: Global error middleware (must be last)

### Routing Structure
- `/health/*` - Health check endpoints (unversioned)
- `/api/v1/*` - Versioned API endpoints
  - `/api/v1/recipe` - Recipe resource endpoints
- API documentation: `/api-docs`

### Required Environment Variables
- `NODE_ENV`: development | production | test
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3000)
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string
- `JWT_SECRET`: JWT signing secret
- `LOG_LEVEL`: error | warn | info | debug (default: info)
- `CORS_ORIGIN`: Comma-separated allowed origins (optional)

### Testing Strategy
- **Framework**: Jest with ts-jest
- **Test Files**: `*.test.ts` files co-located with source
- **Coverage**: Excludes node_modules, dist, config files
- **Setup**: `jest.setup.ts` for test environment configuration

### TypeScript Configuration
- **Target**: ES2020 with CommonJS modules
- **Root**: `./` compiles to `./dist`
- **Strict Mode**: Enabled with all checks
- **Features**: Source maps, declarations, JSON imports

## Project Context

This TypeScript API is a learning project that mirrors the functionality of:
- **C# ASP.NET API** (`../FoodBudgetAPI/`): The original implementation with Entity Framework, migrations, repository pattern
- **React Native App** (`../FoodBudgetMobileApp/`): Mobile client that can connect to either API

Both APIs implement the same FoodBudget functionality. This TypeScript version serves as a practical learning environment for TypeScript, Node.js, and Express patterns.
