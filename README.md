#### ‚úÖ Story 12.5: Error Boundary & Offline Detection
**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to handle errors gracefully and inform me when I'm offline, so I don't see blank screens or confusing error messages.

**Features:** (Completed - Production-Ready)
- ‚úÖ **TanStack Query OnlineManager** - Modern event-based offline detection (no polling, better battery life)
  - NetInfo integration checks BOTH `isConnected` AND `isInternetReachable` (handles captive portals)
  - Event-based detection (no polling overhead)
  - Automatic query/mutation pause when offline
- ‚úÖ **ErrorBoundary Component** - Catches React component errors (no white screens)
  - getDerivedStateFromError for error state management
  - "Try Again" button to reset and re-render
- ‚úÖ **ErrorFallbackScreen** - User-friendly error UI with reset button
  - Development mode shows detailed error information
  - Production mode shows simple user-friendly message
- ‚úÖ **OfflineBanner** - Visual feedback when user is offline
  - Appears at top of screen when device is offline
  - Handles airplane mode, WiFi without internet, cellular failures
- ‚úÖ **Improved Mutation Resilience**
  - Increased retry count from 1 to 2 (more resilient than TanStack Query defaults)
  - Exponential backoff: `Math.min(1000 * 2 ** attemptIndex, 30000)` (matches TanStack Query defaults exactly)
  - Queries: 2 retries, Mutations: 2 retries
- ‚úÖ **2025 Standards Applied:**
  - OnlineManager with NetInfo (official TanStack Query pattern)
  - Network mode: 'online' (queries/mutations pause when offline)
  - RefetchOnReconnect: 'always' (fresh data after reconnecting)
  - Better than basic examples (checks both network states for edge cases)
- ‚úÖ **ErrorBoundary Tests: 8/8 passing**
- ‚úÖ **OfflineBanner Unit Tests: 4/4 passing**
- ‚úÖ **OfflineBanner Integration Tests: 3/3 passing**
- ‚úÖ **ErrorFallbackScreen Tests: 8/8 passing**
- ‚úÖ **Full Test Suite: 635/635 tests passing**

**Why This is Production-Ready:**
- Follows official TanStack Query 2025 standards (verified via docs)
- Handles edge cases: captive portals, airplane mode, WiFi-but-no-internet
- Event-based detection (no polling, better battery life)
- More resilient mutations than framework defaults (2 vs 0 retries)
- Exponential backoff matches industry standards
- Comprehensive error handling for both network and app errors

#### ‚úÖ Story 12.6: API Rate Limiting (Partial)
**User Story:** As the API owner, I want to protect the demo API from abuse so it remains available for portfolio viewers.

**Features:** (Completed - Rate Limiting Only)
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Tier IP-Based Rate Limiting** - AspNetCoreRateLimit 5.0.0
  - 60 requests per minute (prevents burst attacks)
  - 200 requests per 15 minutes
  - 600 requests per hour
  - 2,000 requests per 12 hours (prevents sustained abuse)
  - Returns 429 Too Many Requests when limits exceeded
- ‚úÖ **Health Endpoint Whitelisted** - `/health` excluded from rate limiting
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Logging** - Rate limit violations logged with IP address
- ‚úÖ **Production-Grade Protection** - Multi-tier strategy better than single-limit approach
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **CORS Not Restricted** - Still uses `AllowAnyOrigin()` (security risk, needs to be addressed)

**Why Multi-Tier is Better:**
- Prevents both burst attacks (60/min) and sustained abuse (2000/12hr)
- More sophisticated than single-tier limiting
- Allows normal users to burst occasionally without hitting limits
- Production-grade protection against various attack patterns

**Security Note:**
- CORS restriction deferred to avoid breaking demo during development
- Must be restricted to `https://cadil91.github.io` + `localhost` before production release

#### üîÑ Story 13: Material Design 3 Polish
**User Story:** As a user, I want a polished, professional-looking interface with smooth animations.

**Features:** (Not Started - Optional for Demo)
- MD3 styling refinements (spacing, elevation, shadows)
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Typography hierarchy improvements

## üöÄ Next Sprint: User Management & Authentication

**Sprint 4** will add user authentication and data isolation. See [`docs/sprint-4.md`](./docs/sprint-4.md) for details:
- User registration and login
- JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- User-scoped recipe data
- Password reset flow
- Email verification (optional)

## Architecture

### Application Flow
1. **server.ts**: Entry point - validates environment, configures logger, starts Express
2. **app.ts**: Configures middleware stack, routes, and error handling
3. **config/environment.ts**: Zod-validated environment variables with type safety

### Middleware Stack (Order Critical)
1. **helmet**: Security headers
2. **cors**: Cross-origin handling (before routes)
3. **morgan**: HTTP request logging (logs to Winston)
4. **compression**: Response compression
5. **body-parser**: JSON/URL-encoded parsing (10mb limit)
6. **swagger-ui**: API documentation at `/api-docs`
7. **routes**: Application routes
8. **error handler**: Global error middleware (must be last)

### Routing Structure
- `/health/*` - Health check endpoints (unversioned)
- `/api/v1/*` - Versioned API endpoints
  - `/api/v1/recipe` - Recipe resource endpoints
- API documentation: `/api-docs`

### Required Environment Variables
- `NODE_ENV`: development | production | test
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3000)
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string
- `JWT_SECRET`: JWT signing secret
- `LOG_LEVEL`: error | warn | info | debug (default: info)
- `CORS_ORIGIN`: Comma-separated allowed origins (optional)

### Testing Strategy
- **Framework**: Jest with ts-jest
- **Test Files**: `*.test.ts` files co-located with source
- **Coverage**: Excludes node_modules, dist, config files
- **Setup**: `jest.setup.ts` for test environment configuration

### TypeScript Configuration
- **Target**: ES2020 with CommonJS modules
- **Root**: `./` compiles to `./dist`
- **Strict Mode**: Enabled with all checks
- **Features**: Source maps, declarations, JSON imports

## Project Context

This TypeScript API is a learning project that mirrors the functionality of:
- **C# ASP.NET API** (`../FoodBudgetAPI/`): The original implementation with Entity Framework, migrations, repository pattern
- **React Native App** (`../FoodBudgetMobileApp/`): Mobile client that can connect to either API

Both APIs implement the same FoodBudget functionality. This TypeScript version serves as a practical learning environment for TypeScript, Node.js, and Express patterns.
