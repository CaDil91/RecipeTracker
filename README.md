## Project Overview

FoodBudget is a full-stack recipe management application showcasing modern web and mobile development practices. Built with a C# ASP.NET Core API backend, Azure SQL database, and a cross-platform React Native frontend that runs on web and mobile devices.

## 🚀 Live Demo

**Repo Demo:** [https://cadil91.github.io/RecipeTracker/](https://cadil91.github.io/RecipeTracker/)

The web demo is connected to a live Azure-hosted API with a SQL Server database. Browse recipes, add new ones, edit, and delete - all changes persist to the cloud database in real-time.

**Active Development:** Active development continues in a private repository. View the latest version at [https://cadil91.github.io/FoodBudgetAI/](https://cadil91.github.io/FoodBudgetAI/)

## Active user stories
<details>
<summary><b>✅ Story 6.1: Story 6.1: Add Ingredients to Recipes - Backend API</b></summary>

- Ingredient entity with FK to Recipe, CASCADE delete, and index on RecipeId

      Index is for:
      1. **Fetching ingredients by recipe** - The most common query pattern is `SELECT * FROM Ingredients WHERE RecipeId = @id` (eager loading via `.Include(r => r.Ingredients)`). Without an index, this requires a full table scan.
      2. **CASCADE delete** - When a recipe is deleted, the database needs to find and delete all related ingredients. The index makes this lookup fast.
      3. **JOIN operations** - Any query joining Recipes to Ingredients benefits from the index.

- Smart diff algorithm for PUT updates (preserves ingredient IDs)

      Smart diff decided because we want a shopping list in future with more ingredient features. Example:
      
      User adds "2 cups flour" (ID: abc123) to shopping list
      User edits recipe, changes "salt" to "sea salt"
      Delete/insert runs → flour gets new ID (xyz789)
      Shopping list still references abc123 → broken reference
      
      With smart diff, the flour ingredient keeps ID `abc123` through the update - shopping list reference stays valid.

      Research suggests: Manual smart diff is the recommended pattern for EF Core child collections. There's no built-in solution; everyone writes this logic, which is what I did.

- Max 50 ingredients validation at API level
- TotalCost calculation in Entity since it's a domain calculation

## Architecture

### Application Flow
1. **server.ts**: Entry point - validates environment, configures logger, starts Express
2. **app.ts**: Configures middleware stack, routes, and error handling
3. **config/environment.ts**: Zod-validated environment variables with type safety

### Middleware Stack (Order Critical)
1. **helmet**: Security headers
2. **cors**: Cross-origin handling (before routes)
3. **morgan**: HTTP request logging (logs to Winston)
4. **compression**: Response compression
5. **body-parser**: JSON/URL-encoded parsing (10mb limit)
6. **swagger-ui**: API documentation at `/api-docs`
7. **routes**: Application routes
8. **error handler**: Global error middleware (must be last)

### Routing Structure
- `/health/*` - Health check endpoints (unversioned)
- `/api/v1/*` - Versioned API endpoints
  - `/api/v1/recipe` - Recipe resource endpoints
- API documentation: `/api-docs`

### Required Environment Variables
- `NODE_ENV`: development | production | test
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3000)
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string
- `JWT_SECRET`: JWT signing secret
- `LOG_LEVEL`: error | warn | info | debug (default: info)
- `CORS_ORIGIN`: Comma-separated allowed origins (optional)

### Testing Strategy
- **Framework**: Jest with ts-jest
- **Test Files**: `*.test.ts` files co-located with source
- **Coverage**: Excludes node_modules, dist, config files
- **Setup**: `jest.setup.ts` for test environment configuration

### TypeScript Configuration
- **Target**: ES2020 with CommonJS modules
- **Root**: `./` compiles to `./dist`
- **Strict Mode**: Enabled with all checks
- **Features**: Source maps, declarations, JSON imports

## Project Context

This TypeScript API is a learning project that mirrors the functionality of:
- **C# ASP.NET API** (`../FoodBudgetAPI/`): The original implementation with Entity Framework, migrations, repository pattern
- **React Native App** (`../FoodBudgetMobileApp/`): Mobile client that can connect to either API

Both APIs implement the same FoodBudget functionality. This TypeScript version serves as a practical learning environment for TypeScript, Node.js, and Express patterns.
