## Overview

This document contains features and enhancements planned for future sprints after completing Sprint 4 (User Authentication & Management). Items are prioritized based on production readiness, user value, and technical dependencies.

**Current Status:**
- âœ… Sprint 3 Complete: Recipe Management Demo (110 tests passing)
- ðŸ”„ Sprint 4 In Progress: User Authentication & Management

**2025 Production Score After Sprint 4:** 8.0/10

---

## Sprint 5: Observability & Performance (Priority: HIGH)

**Theme:** Make the production app observable, scalable, and performant
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks
**Dependencies:** Sprint 4 deployed to production

### Why Sprint 5?
With users in production, you need visibility into errors, performance bottlenecks, and usage patterns. These are non-negotiable for production SaaS applications in 2025.

---

### Story 5.1: Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Effort:** Medium (1 week)
**Type:** Observability

**User Story:**
> As a developer, I need to monitor application performance and errors in production so I can debug issues and optimize user experience.

**Why Critical for 2025:**
- Cannot debug production issues without observability
- Expected in all SaaS products for incident response
- Required for meeting SLA commitments

**Scope:**
- Integrate Sentry or Application Insights for error tracking
- Set up performance monitoring (API response times, frontend render times)
- Configure error alerting (Slack/email notifications)
- Add custom error context (user ID, recipe ID, action performed)
- Track JavaScript errors with source maps
- Monitor API endpoint performance

**Implementation:**
- **Frontend:** Sentry SDK integration
- **Backend:** Application Insights SDK or Sentry .NET SDK
- **Configuration:** Error sampling, release tracking, environment tagging

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Frontend errors captured with stack traces
- [ ] Backend exceptions logged to APM service
- [ ] Performance metrics visible in dashboard
- [ ] Alert notifications configured (critical errors only)
- [ ] Source maps uploaded for readable stack traces
- [ ] User context attached to error reports
- [ ] API response times tracked per endpoint

**Files to Create:**
- Frontend: `lib/shared/services/monitoring.ts`
- Frontend: `lib/shared/utils/error-reporting.ts`
- Backend: `Services/MonitoringService.cs`
- Backend: `Middleware/PerformanceMonitoringMiddleware.cs`

**Files to Modify:**
- Frontend: `App.tsx` (initialize Sentry)
- Frontend: `components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (send to Sentry)
- Backend: `Program.cs` (register Application Insights)
- Backend: `Middleware/ExceptionHandlingMiddleware.cs` (log to APM)

**Estimated Cost:**
- Sentry: Free tier (5K errors/month) or $26/month for growth
- Application Insights: ~$2-10/month for low-medium traffic

---

### Story 5.2: API Pagination
**Priority:** HIGH
**Effort:** Medium (1 week)
**Type:** Performance & Scalability

**User Story:**
> As a user with many recipes, I want the app to load quickly even with 100+ recipes in my collection.

**Why Needed for 2025:**
- Fetching all records doesn't scale beyond 100+ items
- Standard REST API pattern expected since 2015
- Mobile users benefit from reduced data transfer

**Scope:**
- Add pagination support to GET /api/Recipe endpoint
- Implement cursor-based or offset-based pagination
- Add `Link` headers for next/prev pages (RFC 5988)
- Frontend infinite scroll or "Load More" button
- Update TanStack Query to support paginated queries

**Implementation:**
```csharp
// Backend: GET /api/Recipe?page=1&pageSize=20
public async Task<ActionResult<PagedResult<RecipeResponseDto>>> GetRecipes(
    [FromQuery] int page = 1,
    [FromQuery] int pageSize = 20)
{
    var recipes = await _recipeService.GetRecipesPaged(userId, page, pageSize);
    var total = await _recipeService.GetRecipesCount(userId);

    return Ok(new PagedResult<RecipeResponseDto>
    {
        Data = recipes,
        Page = page,
        PageSize = pageSize,
        TotalCount = total,
        TotalPages = (int)Math.Ceiling(total / (double)pageSize)
    });
}
```

```typescript
// Frontend: TanStack Query infinite scroll
const { data, fetchNextPage, hasNextPage } = useInfiniteQuery({
  queryKey: ['recipes'],
  queryFn: ({ pageParam = 1 }) => RecipeService.getRecipesPaged(pageParam, 20),
  getNextPageParam: (lastPage) => lastPage.hasMore ? lastPage.nextPage : undefined,
});
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] API returns paginated results (default 20 per page)
- [ ] Link headers included (next, prev, first, last)
- [ ] Frontend displays first page on load
- [ ] User can load more recipes (infinite scroll or button)
- [ ] Performance improves for users with 100+ recipes
- [ ] Backward compatible (optional pagination parameters)
- [ ] Search and filters work with pagination

**Files to Create:**
- Backend: `Models/DTOs/PagedResult.cs`
- Frontend: `hooks/useInfiniteRecipes.ts`

**Files to Modify:**
- Backend: `Services/IRecipeService.cs` (add paged methods)
- Backend: `Services/RecipeService.cs` (implement paging)
- Backend: `Controllers/RecipeController.cs` (add pagination params)
- Frontend: `screens/RecipeListScreen.tsx` (use infinite query)
