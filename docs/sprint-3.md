## Phase 3: Unified Recipe Detail Screen (CURRENT FOCUS)

### Navigation Architecture (RecipeDetailScreen)

**Decision:** Implemented using **2025 React Navigation Best Practices** (minimal params + local state)

#### Route Parameter Design
```typescript
RecipeDetail: {
    recipeId?: string;  // Only pass the ID (undefined for CREATE mode)
}
```

#### Mode Management Pattern
- **Mode stored in local component state** (not navigation params)
- Uses React `useState` for mode transitions
- Follows React Navigation 2025 guidance: "Pass minimal data in params"

#### Navigation Flow

**VIEW Mode (Story 8):**
- **Entry:** User taps recipe card from RecipeListScreen
- **Params:** `{ recipeId: '123' }`
- **Initial Mode:** `'view'` (read-only)
- **Actions:**
  - Back button → RecipeListScreen
  - Edit FAB → Internal state change to `'edit'` (no navigation)

**CREATE Mode (Story 9):**
- **Entry:** User taps FAB from RecipeListScreen
- **Params:** `{}` or `{ recipeId: undefined }`
- **Initial Mode:** `'create'`
- **Actions:**
  - Save → Navigate back to RecipeListScreen
  - Cancel → Navigate back to RecipeListScreen

**EDIT Mode (Story 10):**
- **Entry:** User taps Edit FAB while in VIEW mode
- **Transition:** Internal state change (`setCurrentMode('edit')`) - **NO navigation**
- **Actions:**
  - Save → Internal state change back to `'view'` + API update
  - Cancel → Internal state change back to `'view'` (no changes)

#### Implementation Example

```typescript
// Inside RecipeDetailScreen.tsx
const { recipeId } = route.params || {};

// Local state for mode (2025 best practice)
const [currentMode, setCurrentMode] = useState<'view' | 'edit' | 'create'>(() =>
    recipeId ? 'view' : 'create'
);

// Fetch data using TanStack Query
const { data: recipe, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['recipe', recipeId],
    queryFn: () => RecipeService.getRecipeById(recipeId!),
    enabled: !!recipeId,  // Only fetch if ID exists (not CREATE mode)
});
```

#### Navigation Calls

```typescript
// VIEW mode - from recipe card
navigation.navigate('RecipeDetail', { recipeId: recipe.id });

// CREATE mode - from FAB
navigation.navigate('RecipeDetail', {});

// EDIT mode - internal state change (no navigation)
setCurrentMode('edit');
```

#### Rationale (2025 Best Practices)

✅ **Minimal params** - Only pass IDs, not full objects or UI state
✅ **Local state for UI modes** - useState for view/edit/create transitions
✅ **Data fetching in component** - TanStack Query fetches by ID
✅ **Deep linking ready** - URL pattern: `/recipe/:id` (no mode param)
✅ **Better testability** - No navigation mock complexity for mode changes
✅ **Cache-friendly** - Simple query keys: `['recipe', id]`

**Sources:**
- React Navigation Docs (2025): "Passing parameters to routes"
- TanStack Query v5 Patterns: "Optimistic updates with cache manipulation"

#### Route Changes
- ❌ **REMOVED:** `AddRecipe` route (replaced by CREATE mode)
- ✅ **ADDED:** `RecipeDetail` route with optional `recipeId`

### Story 7: Enhanced Recipe Data Model (Category + Image)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**User Story:**
As a developer, I need the recipe data model to support category and image fields so users can better organize and visualize their recipes.

**Scope:**

### Story 12: Optimistic Updates with TanStack Query (SPLIT INTO 12a, 12b, 12c)

**⚠️ This story has been split into three phased implementations for better risk management and incremental delivery. See Stories 12a, 12b, and 12c below.**

---

### Story 12a: Optimistic Delete with Rollback
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority:** HIGH
**Type:** UX Enhancement
**Dependencies:** Story 11
**Estimated Effort:** Small (5-6 hours)
**Actual Effort:** ~5 hours (TDD implementation)

**2025 Standards Applied:**
✅ Cache Manipulation (multi-location updates)
✅ Manual Rollback + Refetch (fast + consistent)
✅ Retry Actions (user-friendly errors)
✅ Query Cancellation (concurrent handling)

**User Story:**
As a user, I want deleted recipes to disappear instantly so the app feels responsive, with automatic rollback if the deletion fails.

**Why Start Here?**
- ✅ Simplest optimistic update (no temp IDs, no navigation concerns)
- ✅ Delete mutation already exists in RecipeListScreen
- ✅ Validates the optimistic pattern before tackling complex scenarios
- ✅ Immediate UX improvement with low risk

**Current Behavior:**
Delete: Confirm → Wait → Snackbar → List refetches

**Target Behavior:**
Delete: Confirm → **Instantly disappears** → API deletes in background → Success/Rollback

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [x] Create `FoodBudgetMobileApp/src/hooks/` directory
- [x] Create `hooks/useRecipeMutations.ts` with optimistic delete
- [x] Migrate delete mutation from RecipeListScreen to hook
- [x] Add onMutate to remove from cache immediately
- [x] Add onError with rollback + refetch for consistency
- [x] Add onSuccess with refetch for consistency
- [x] Add retry action to error snackbar
- [x] Write tests in `hooks/__tests__/useRecipeMutations.test.tsx` (11 tests)
- [x] Add RecipeListScreen unit tests (5 tests)
- [x] Add RecipeListScreen integration tests (7 tests)

**Files to Create:**
- `FoodBudgetMobileApp/src/hooks/useRecipeMutations.ts`
- `FoodBudgetMobileApp/src/hooks/__tests__/useRecipeMutations.test.tsx`

**Files to Modify:**
- `screens/RecipeListScreen.tsx:90-110` - Use new hook instead of inline mutation

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// hooks/useRecipeMutations.ts
import { useMutation, useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { RecipeService } from '../lib/shared/api/recipe.service';
import type { RecipeResponseDto } from '../lib/shared/types/dto';

export const useDeleteRecipe = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: RecipeService.deleteRecipe,
    onMutate: async (recipeId: string) => {
      // Cancel outgoing refetches (handles concurrency)
      await queryClient.cancelQueries({ queryKey: ['recipes'] });

      // Snapshot current state for rollback
      const previousRecipes = queryClient.getQueryData<RecipeResponseDto[]>(['recipes']);

      // Optimistically remove from cache
      queryClient.setQueryData<RecipeResponseDto[]>(['recipes'], (old) =>
        old?.filter(r => r.id !== recipeId) || []
      );

      return { previousRecipes, recipeId };
    },
    onError: (err, recipeId, context) => {
      // Manual rollback (instant)
      if (context?.previousRecipes) {
        queryClient.setQueryData(['recipes'], context.previousRecipes);
      }

      // Refetch for consistency (background)
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['recipes'] });

      // Error snackbar with retry handled by UI
    },
    onSuccess: () => {
      // Success snackbar handled by UI
      // NO invalidate - trust optimistic update
    },
  });
};
```

**Usage in RecipeListScreen:**
```typescript
const deleteMutation = useDeleteRecipe();

const handleDelete = async (recipeId: string) => {
  try {
    await deleteMutation.mutateAsync(recipeId);
    showSnackbar({ message: 'Recipe deleted', type: 'success' });
  } catch (error) {
    showSnackbar({
      message: 'Failed to delete recipe',
      type: 'error',
      action: {
        label: 'Retry',
        onPress: () => handleDelete(recipeId)
      }
    });
  }
};
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Deleted recipe disappears instantly from list
- [x] Failed delete operations rollback cleanly (recipe reappears)
- [x] Background refetch ensures consistency after error
- [x] Success snackbar shown after successful delete
- [x] Error snackbar shown with retry action after failed delete
- [x] No duplicate recipes after rollback
- [x] Tests verify optimistic update and rollback behavior (23 tests)
- [x] Query cancellation prevents race conditions

**Test Results:**
- ✅ 11/11 hook unit tests passing
- ✅ 5/5 RecipeListScreen unit tests passing
- ✅ 7/7 RecipeListScreen integration tests passing
- **Total: 23/23 tests passing (100%)**

### Story 12b: Optimistic Update with Consistency
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Commit:** [d2f490c](../../commit/d2f490c)
**Priority:** HIGH
**Type:** UX Enhancement
**Dependencies:** Story 12a
**Estimated Effort:** Medium (7-8 hours)
**Actual Effort:** ~6 hours (TDD implementation with full test suite restoration)

**2025 Standards Applied:**
✅ Cache Manipulation (multi-location updates)
✅ Manual Rollback + Refetch (fast + consistent)
✅ Retry Actions (user-friendly errors)
✅ Query Cancellation (concurrent handling)

**User Story:**
As a user, I want recipe updates to show instantly in both the detail screen and list so I see my changes immediately.

**Why Second?**
- ✅ Builds on delete pattern from 12a
- ✅ No temp ID complexity (recipe already has real ID)
- ✅ Validates cache consistency between detail and list views
- ✅ Sets up foundation for create (most complex)

**Current Behavior:**
Update: Submit → Wait → Alert → Navigate → List refetches

**Target Behavior:**
Update: Submit → **Instantly updates in list** → API saves in background → Success/Rollback → Navigate

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [x] Add `useUpdateRecipe` to `hooks/useRecipeMutations.ts`
- [x] Update both ['recipes'] and ['recipe', id] query keys optimistically
- [x] Update category-specific caches (['recipes', 'All'], ['recipes', 'Breakfast'], etc.)
- [x] Add rollback for both caches on error + refetch
- [x] Manual retry enabled by staying in EDIT mode on error
- [x] Navigation blocked until API confirms (no navigation in handleEditSubmit until success)
- [x] Add tests for update optimistic flow (13 hook tests + 5 unit tests + 6 integration tests)
- [x] Fix all existing test suite failures (restored to 580/580 passing)

**Files Modified:**
- `hooks/useRecipeMutations.ts` - Added useUpdateRecipe with multi-cache optimistic updates
- `screens/RecipeDetailScreen.tsx` - Integrated useUpdateRecipe hook for EDIT mode
- `hooks/__tests__/useRecipeMutations.test.tsx` - Added 13 comprehensive update tests
- `screens/__tests__/RecipeDetailScreen.unit.test.tsx` - 5 new Story 12b tests
- `screens/__tests__/RecipeDetailScreen.integration.test.tsx` - 6 new Story 12b tests
- `mocks/handlers/recipes.ts` - Fixed MSW URL pattern (/api/Recipe/search)

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// hooks/useRecipeMutations.ts
export const useUpdateRecipe = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: ({ id, data }: { id: string; data: RecipeUpdateDto }) =>
      RecipeService.updateRecipe(id, data),
    onMutate: async ({ id, data }) => {
      await queryClient.cancelQueries({ queryKey: ['recipes'] });
      await queryClient.cancelQueries({ queryKey: ['recipe', id] });

      const previousRecipes = queryClient.getQueryData<RecipeResponseDto[]>(['recipes']);
      const previousRecipe = queryClient.getQueryData<RecipeResponseDto>(['recipe', id]);

      // Optimistically update in list
      queryClient.setQueryData<RecipeResponseDto[]>(['recipes'], (old) =>
        old?.map(r => r.id === id ? { ...r, ...data } : r) || []
      );

      // Optimistically update in detail
      queryClient.setQueryData<RecipeResponseDto>(['recipe', id], (old) =>
        old ? { ...old, ...data } : old
      );

      return { previousRecipes, previousRecipe, id };
    },
    onError: (err, { id }, context) => {
      // Rollback both caches
      if (context?.previousRecipes) {
        queryClient.setQueryData(['recipes'], context.previousRecipes);
      }
      if (context?.previousRecipe) {
        queryClient.setQueryData(['recipe', id], context.previousRecipe);
      }

      // Refetch for consistency
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['recipes'] });
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['recipe', id] });
    },
    onSuccess: (updatedRecipe, { id }) => {
      // Replace optimistic data with server response
      queryClient.setQueryData(['recipes'], (old: RecipeResponseDto[] | undefined) =>
        old?.map(r => r.id === id ? updatedRecipe : r) || []
      );
      queryClient.setQueryData(['recipe', id], updatedRecipe);
    },
  });
};
```

**Test Results:**
- ✅ **Hook Tests:** 13/13 passing (useUpdateRecipe)
  - Risk-Based Priority: Multi-cache optimistic updates (list + detail + categories)
  - Happy Path: Successful update with server response replacement
  - Error Handling: Rollback both caches on failure + background refetch

### Story 12.5: Error Boundary & Offline Detection
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Commits:**
- [4d7efdb](../../commit/4d7efdb) - Production-ready error handling and offline detection
- [18b7342](../../commit/18b7342) - Platform-specific offline detection for web and native
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Type:** Reliability & UX
**Dependencies:** Story 11
**Estimated Effort:** Small (4-5 hours)
**Actual Effort:** ~6 hours (includes 2025 standards research and optimization)

**2025 Standards Applied:**
✅ TanStack Query OnlineManager (event-based offline detection)
✅ NetInfo integration (checks both `isConnected` AND `isInternetReachable`)
✅ Network mode: 'online' (pauses queries/mutations when offline)
✅ Exponential backoff retry strategy (industry standard)
✅ React Error Boundaries (standard since React 16)

**User Story:**
As a user, I want the app to handle errors gracefully and inform me when I'm offline, so I don't see blank screens or confusing error messages.

**Implementation Summary:**
- ✅ **TanStack Query OnlineManager** - Modern event-based offline detection (no polling)
- ✅ **ErrorBoundary Component** - Catches React component errors
- ✅ **ErrorFallbackScreen** - User-friendly error UI with reset
- ✅ **OfflineBanner** - Visual feedback when user is offline
- ✅ **Improved Mutation Resilience** - Increased retry count and exponential backoff

**Key Architecture Decisions:**

**1. Offline Detection Strategy (2025 Standard):**
- **Rejected:** Manual health check endpoints (false negatives, server load)
- **Rejected:** `navigator.onLine` only (unreliable for captive portals)
- **Implemented:** TanStack Query OnlineManager + NetInfo
  - Checks BOTH `isConnected` AND `isInternetReachable`
  - Handles WiFi-but-no-internet scenarios (captive portals)
  - Event-based (no polling, better performance)

**2. Query/Mutation Behavior:**
- `networkMode: 'online'` - Queries/mutations pause when offline
- Automatic resume on reconnect
- `refetchOnReconnect: 'always'` - Fresh data after reconnecting

**3. Retry Strategy:**
- Queries: 2 retries (default is 3)
- Mutations: 2 retries (default is 0 - we're more resilient)
- Retry delay: `Math.min(1000 * 2 ** attemptIndex, 30000)` - Exponential backoff
  - 1st retry: 1s, 2nd retry: 2s, cap at 30s

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [x] Create ErrorBoundary component with getDerivedStateFromError
- [x] Create ErrorFallbackScreen with "Try Again" button
- [x] Create OfflineBanner component with NetInfo integration
- [x] Wrap App root with ErrorBoundary
- [x] Configure TanStack Query OnlineManager with NetInfo
- [x] Set networkMode: 'online' for queries and mutations
- [x] Increase mutation retry count from 1 to 2
- [x] Add exponential backoff for mutations
- [x] Fix ErrorFallbackScreen TouchableRipple issue
- [x] Unit tests for ErrorBoundary (8 tests)
- [x] Unit tests for OfflineBanner (4 tests)
- [x] Integration tests for OfflineBanner (3 tests)
- [x] Integration tests for ErrorBoundary (removed placeholder tests)
- [x] All 635 tests passing after implementation

**Files Created:**
- ✅ `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - React error boundary
- ✅ `src/screens/ErrorFallbackScreen.tsx` - Error UI with reset button
- ✅ `src/components/OfflineBanner.tsx` - Offline visual indicator
- ✅ `src/components/__tests__/ErrorBoundary.test.tsx` - 8 comprehensive tests
- ✅ `src/components/__tests__/OfflineBanner.test.tsx` - 4 unit tests
- ✅ `src/components/__tests__/OfflineBanner.integration.test.tsx` - 3 integration tests

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ `App.tsx:22-52` - OnlineManager setup + QueryClient configuration
  - OnlineManager with NetInfo listener
  - Network mode: 'online' for queries/mutations
  - Mutation retry: 2 with exponential backoff
  - Wrapped app with ErrorBoundary
  - Added OfflineBanner at app root
- ✅ `src/screens/ErrorFallbackScreen.tsx` - Fixed Card.Title onPress with TouchableRipple

**Files NOT Modified (Simpler Approach):**
- ❌ `fetch-client.ts` - NO manual connectivity checks (TanStack Query handles it)
- ❌ No health check endpoints needed
- ❌ No navigator.onLine checks (NetInfo is more reliable)

**Files Deleted (Cleanup):**
- ✅ Removed placeholder test files that didn't follow naming conventions
- ✅ All obsolete mocks and test helpers

**Test Results:**
- ✅ **ErrorBoundary Tests:** 8/8 passing
  - Risk-Based Priority: Error catching, state updates, error logging
  - Happy Path: Normal rendering without errors
  - Errors: Multiple sequential errors, error in fallback
- ✅ **OfflineBanner Unit Tests:** 4/4 passing
  - Online state (hidden), Offline state (visible)
  - Airplane mode, WiFi but no internet
- ✅ **OfflineBanner Integration Tests:** 3/3 passing
  - Real-time network status updates
  - Banner persists across navigation
  - WiFi to cellular transitions
- ✅ **ErrorFallbackScreen Tests:** 8/8 passing
  - User-friendly error messages, Try again button
  - Development mode error details
- ✅ **Full Test Suite:** 635/635 tests passing

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] ErrorBoundary wraps app root in App.tsx
- [x] Component errors caught by ErrorBoundary (no white screen)
- [x] ErrorFallbackScreen shows with user-friendly message
- [x] "Try Again" button resets error state and re-renders app
- [x] TanStack Query OnlineManager integrated with NetInfo
- [x] Queries/mutations pause when offline (networkMode: 'online')
- [x] OfflineBanner shows when device is offline
- [x] OfflineBanner handles captive portals (WiFi-but-no-internet)
- [x] Automatic refetch on reconnect
- [x] Mutations retry 2 times with exponential backoff
- [x] All 635 tests passing
- [x] Implementation follows 2025 standards (verified via TanStack Query docs)

**Why This Implementation is Production-Ready:**
- ✅ Follows official TanStack Query 2025 standards
- ✅ Handles edge cases (captive portals, airplane mode)
- ✅ Better than basic examples (checks both network states)
- ✅ Event-based detection (no polling, better battery life)
- ✅ Exponential backoff matches TanStack Query defaults exactly
- ✅ More resilient mutations than framework defaults
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling for both network and app errors

### Story 12.6: Demo API Protection (Optional)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (Partial - Rate Limiting Implemented)
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Type:** Security & Infrastructure
**Dependencies:** Story 12.5
**Estimated Effort:** Small (2-3 hours)

**User Story:**
As the API owner, I want to protect the demo API from abuse so it remains available for portfolio viewers and doesn't incur unexpected Azure costs.

**Why Needed for 2025 Production:**
- **Rate Limiting:** Public APIs without rate limiting are targets for abuse
- **CORS Restriction:** `AllowAnyOrigin()` is a security vulnerability flagged by scanners
- **Cost Control:** Prevents demo API from being overwhelmed and incurring Azure overages
- **Professional Standard:** Shows understanding of production API protection

**Implementation Status:**
- ✅ **Rate Limiting Implemented** - Multi-tier IP-based rate limiting with AspNetCoreRateLimit 5.0.0
- ⚠️ **CORS Still Unrestricted** - `AllowAnyOrigin()` remains (to be addressed before production)

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [x] Add AspNetCoreRateLimit NuGet package (v5.0.0)
- [x] Configure in-memory rate limiting (multi-tier strategy - see below)
- [x] Add rate limiting middleware to pipeline
- [x] Health endpoint whitelisted from rate limiting
- [ ] ⚠️ Update appsettings.json with AllowedOrigins (deferred)
- [ ] ⚠️ Restrict CORS to demo origin + localhost (deferred)
- [x] Add logging for rate limit violations (via AspNetCoreRateLimit)
- [ ] Test rate limiting with rapid requests (manual testing pending)

**Files to Create:**
- None (uses AspNetCoreRateLimit library)

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ `FoodBudgetAPI/FoodBudgetAPI.csproj:21` - Added AspNetCoreRateLimit 5.0.0 package
- ✅ `FoodBudgetAPI/Utility/Setup/ServiceConfiguration.cs:30-34,131-141` - Memory cache + rate limiting services
- ✅ `FoodBudgetAPI/Utility/Setup/ApplicationConfiguration.cs:43` - Middleware added after CORS
- ✅ `FoodBudgetAPI/appsettings.json:12-43` - Multi-tier rate limiting configuration
- ⚠️ `FoodBudgetAPI/Utility/Setup/ServiceConfiguration.cs:96` - CORS still uses `AllowAnyOrigin()` (deferred)

**Technical Implementation:**

**Multi-Tier Rate Limiting Strategy** (Better than single 100 req/min limit):
```csharp
// ServiceConfiguration.cs:131-141 - Rate limiting service registration
private static void ConfigureRateLimiting(WebApplicationBuilder builder)
{
    // Load configuration from appsettings.json
    builder.Services.Configure<IpRateLimitOptions>(builder.Configuration.GetSection("IpRateLimiting"));

    // Inject counter and rules stores
    builder.Services.AddSingleton<IIpPolicyStore, MemoryCacheIpPolicyStore>();
    builder.Services.AddSingleton<IRateLimitCounterStore, MemoryCacheRateLimitCounterStore>();
    builder.Services.AddSingleton<IRateLimitConfiguration, RateLimitConfiguration>();
    builder.Services.AddSingleton<IProcessingStrategy, AsyncKeyLockProcessingStrategy>();
}

// ApplicationConfiguration.cs:43 - Middleware registration
app.UseIpRateLimiting();

// appsettings.json:12-43 - Multi-tier rate limiting configuration
{
  "IpRateLimiting": {
    "EnableEndpointRateLimiting": true,
    "StackBlockedRequests": false,
    "HttpStatusCode": 429,
    "EndpointWhitelist": [
      "get:/health"  // Health checks excluded from rate limiting
    ],
    "GeneralRules": [
      { "Endpoint": "*", "Period": "1m", "Limit": 60 },      // 60 req/min
      { "Endpoint": "*", "Period": "15m", "Limit": 200 },    // 200 req/15min
      { "Endpoint": "*", "Period": "1h", "Limit": 600 },     // 600 req/hour
      { "Endpoint": "*", "Period": "12h", "Limit": 2000 }    // 2000 req/12hr
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why Multi-Tier is Better:**
- Prevents both burst attacks (60/min) and sustained abuse (2000/12hr)
- More sophisticated than single-tier limiting
- Production-grade protection against various attack patterns
- Allows normal users to burst occasionally without hitting limits

**CORS Configuration (Not Yet Implemented):**
```csharp
// ServiceConfiguration.cs:96 - ⚠️ Still uses AllowAnyOrigin()
policy.AllowAnyOrigin()  // SECURITY RISK - needs to be restricted
    .AllowAnyMethod()
    .AllowAnyHeader();

// TODO: Replace with restricted origins before production
// var allowedOrigins = builder.Configuration.GetValue<string>("AllowedOrigins")
//     ?.Split(',') ?? Array.Empty<string>();
// policy.WithOrigins(allowedOrigins).AllowAnyMethod().AllowAnyHeader();
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Rate limiting enabled (multi-tier: 60/min, 200/15min, 600/hr, 2000/12hr per IP)
- [x] 429 Too Many Requests returned when limit exceeded
- [x] Rate limit violations logged with IP address (via AspNetCoreRateLimit)
- [x] Health endpoint whitelisted from rate limiting
- [ ] ⚠️ CORS restricted to GitHub Pages demo URL + localhost (deferred)
- [ ] ⚠️ CORS preflight requests tested with restricted origins (deferred)
- [ ] ⚠️ Demo app tested with restricted CORS (deferred)
- [x] Rate limiting configured to not affect normal demo usage (generous limits)

**Why This is Optional for Sprint 3:**
- Not a demo blocker (nice-to-have)
- Quick security win before public launch
- Can be added after initial demo if time is tight
