## Phase 3: Unified Recipe Detail Screen (CURRENT FOCUS)

### Story 7: Unified RecipeDetail Screen (View/Edit/Create)
**Status:** üî¥ NOT STARTED
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Type:** Core Feature
**Dependencies:** Stories 4‚Äì6 (completed)

**User Story:**
As a user, I want a unified interface to view, edit, and create recipes with clear mode transitions.

**Requirements:**

**Three Modes:**
1. **CREATE mode** (from FAB/Add tab):
   - Form is shown immediately in the edit state
   - Empty fields ready for input
   - "Save Recipe" button
   - No Edit button needed

2. **VIEW mode** (from tapping recipe card):
   - Read-only display of recipe details
   - Show: title, category, servings, instructions, image
   - Floating Edit FAB or header Edit button
   - Delete button in header menu
   - No form inputs are visible

3. **EDIT mode** (from the Edit button in VIEW mode):
   - Same form as CREATE but pre-populated
   - "Update Recipe" button
   - Cancel button returns to VIEW mode
   - Save triggers API update

**Navigation Routes:**
```
/recipes/new ‚Üí CREATE mode
/recipes/:id ‚Üí VIEW mode (read-only)
/recipes/:id?mode=edit ‚Üí EDIT mode (form enabled)
```

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Create a RecipeDetailScreen component with a mode state
- [ ] Implement mode detection from route params
- [ ] CREATE mode: Form visible, no recipe data fetch
- [ ] VIEW mode: Fetch a recipe by ID, display read-only
- [ ] EDIT mode: Fetch recipe, populate form, enable editing
- [ ] Add Edit FAB/button in VIEW mode
- [ ] Add the Delete button in the header (VIEW and EDIT modes)
- [ ] Mode transition: VIEW ‚Üí EDIT ‚Üí VIEW after save
- [ ] Update mutation with TanStack Query
- [ ] Navigate from RecipeListScreen card tap to VIEW mode
- [ ] Navigate from FAB/Add tab to CREATE mode
- [ ] Update navigation types for new routes
- [ ] **Remove AddRecipeScreen** (replaced by CREATE mode)
- [ ] Update Adds tab to navigate to CREATE mode
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests (unit + integration)

**Files to Create:**
- `screens/RecipeDetailScreen.tsx` - Main unified screen
- `screens/__tests__/RecipeDetailScreen.test.tsx` - Unit tests
- `screens/__tests__/RecipeDetailScreen.integration.test.tsx` - Integration tests

**Files to Modify:**
- `navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` - Add RecipeDetail route to HomeStack, update Add tab navigation
- `types/navigation.ts` - Add RecipeDetail route params
- `screens/RecipeListScreen.tsx:77-81` - Navigate to VIEW mode on card tap
- `components/shared/recipe/RecipeForm.tsx` - Support mode prop for UI adjustments

**Files to Delete:**
- ‚ùå `screens/AddRecipeScreen.tsx` - Replaced by RecipeDetailScreen CREATE mode
- ‚ùå `screens/__tests__/AddRecipeScreen.test.tsx`
- ‚ùå `screens/__tests__/AddRecipeScreen.integration.test.tsx`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Tapping the recipe card opens VIEW mode (read-only)
- [ ] VIEW mode shows all recipe data clearly
- [ ] Edit button in VIEW mode switches to EDIT mode
- [ ] EDIT mode pre-populates a form with current data
- [ ] Saving in EDIT mode updates recipe and returns to VIEW mode
- [ ] Cancel in EDIT mode returns to VIEW mode without changes
- [ ] FAB/Add tab opens CREATE mode with empty form
- [ ] CREATE mode saves new recipe and navigates back to list
- [ ] Delete works from VIEW and EDIT modes
- [ ] All modes have proper loading states
- [ ] Error handling for API failures
- [ ] Optimistic updates (Story 9) work seamlessly

**Technical Notes:**
- Use single RecipeDetailScreen with `mode` state
- Mode determined by route params on mount
- Reuse RecipeForm component for both CREATE and EDIT
- VIEW mode uses custom read-only layout (not RecipeForm)
- TanStack Query for fetching individual recipe
- Mutation hooks for update operation

  mutationFn: RecipeService.createRecipe,
  onMutate: async (newRecipe) => {
    await queryClient.cancelQueries({ queryKey: ['recipes'] });
    const previous = queryClient.getQueryData(['recipes']);

    // Optimistically add with temporary ID
    const optimisticRecipe = {
      ...newRecipe,
      id: `temp-${Date.now()}`,
      createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
    };

    queryClient.setQueryData(['recipes'], (old) =>
      [optimisticRecipe, ...(old || [])]
    );

    return { previous };
  },
  onError: (err, variables, context) => {
    // Rollback on error
    if (context?.previous) {
      queryClient.setQueryData(['recipes'], context.previous);
    }
  },
  onSuccess: (data) => {
    // Replace temp ID with real ID
    queryClient.setQueryData(['recipes'], (old) =>
      old.map(r => r.id.startsWith('temp-') ? data : r)
    );
