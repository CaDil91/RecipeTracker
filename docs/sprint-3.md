## Phase 3: Unified Recipe Detail Screen (CURRENT FOCUS)

### Navigation Architecture (RecipeDetailScreen)

**Decision:** Implemented using **2025 React Navigation Best Practices** (minimal params + local state)

#### Route Parameter Design
```typescript
RecipeDetail: {
    recipeId?: string;  // Only pass the ID (undefined for CREATE mode)
}
```

#### Mode Management Pattern
- **Mode stored in local component state** (not navigation params)
- Uses React `useState` for mode transitions
- Follows React Navigation 2025 guidance: "Pass minimal data in params"

#### Navigation Flow

**VIEW Mode (Story 8):**
- **Entry:** User taps recipe card from RecipeListScreen
- **Params:** `{ recipeId: '123' }`
- **Initial Mode:** `'view'` (read-only)
- **Actions:**
  - Back button → RecipeListScreen
  - Edit FAB → Internal state change to `'edit'` (no navigation)

**CREATE Mode (Story 9):**
- **Entry:** User taps FAB from RecipeListScreen
- **Params:** `{}` or `{ recipeId: undefined }`
- **Initial Mode:** `'create'`
- **Actions:**
  - Save → Navigate back to RecipeListScreen
  - Cancel → Navigate back to RecipeListScreen

**EDIT Mode (Story 10):**
- **Entry:** User taps Edit FAB while in VIEW mode
- **Transition:** Internal state change (`setCurrentMode('edit')`) - **NO navigation**
- **Actions:**
  - Save → Internal state change back to `'view'` + API update
  - Cancel → Internal state change back to `'view'` (no changes)

#### Implementation Example

```typescript
// Inside RecipeDetailScreen.tsx
const { recipeId } = route.params || {};

// Local state for mode (2025 best practice)
const [currentMode, setCurrentMode] = useState<'view' | 'edit' | 'create'>(() =>
    recipeId ? 'view' : 'create'
);

// Fetch data using TanStack Query
const { data: recipe, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['recipe', recipeId],
    queryFn: () => RecipeService.getRecipeById(recipeId!),
    enabled: !!recipeId,  // Only fetch if ID exists (not CREATE mode)
});
```

#### Navigation Calls

```typescript
// VIEW mode - from recipe card
navigation.navigate('RecipeDetail', { recipeId: recipe.id });

// CREATE mode - from FAB
navigation.navigate('RecipeDetail', {});

// EDIT mode - internal state change (no navigation)
setCurrentMode('edit');
```

#### Rationale (2025 Best Practices)

✅ **Minimal params** - Only pass IDs, not full objects or UI state
✅ **Local state for UI modes** - useState for view/edit/create transitions
✅ **Data fetching in component** - TanStack Query fetches by ID
✅ **Deep linking ready** - URL pattern: `/recipe/:id` (no mode param)
✅ **Better testability** - No navigation mock complexity for mode changes
✅ **Cache-friendly** - Simple query keys: `['recipe', id]`

**Sources:**
- React Navigation Docs (2025): "Passing parameters to routes"
- TanStack Query v5 Patterns: "Optimistic updates with cache manipulation"

#### Route Changes
- ❌ **REMOVED:** `AddRecipe` route (replaced by CREATE mode)
- ✅ **ADDED:** `RecipeDetail` route with optional `recipeId`

### Story 7: Enhanced Recipe Data Model (Category + Image)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**User Story:**
As a developer, I need the recipe data model to support category and image fields so users can better organize and visualize their recipes.

**Scope:**

- ✅ `screens/__tests__/AddRecipeScreen.test.tsx` (removed in Story 9)
- ✅ `screens/__tests__/AddRecipeScreen.integration.test.tsx` (removed in Story 9)

**Test Results:**
- ✅ **RecipeDetailScreen Unit Tests:** 85/85 passing
  - Risk-Based Priority: Delete button visibility, confirmation dialog, API integration, cache invalidation
  - Null/Empty/Invalid: Cancel confirmation dialog behavior
  - Boundaries: Delete button excluded from CREATE mode
  - Business Rules: Delete only in VIEW/EDIT modes
  - Error Handling: API 500/404 errors, network failures, stays on screen on error
- ✅ **RecipeDetailScreen Integration Tests:** 25/25 passing
  - Section 1 (Risk-Based Priority): DELETE success flow with navigation (1 test)
  - Section 4 (Error Propagation): DELETE API errors 500/404 (2 tests)
- ✅ **Total: 110 tests passing** (85 unit + 25 integration)

**Implementation Details:**
- Delete button appears in VIEW and EDIT mode headers (IconButton with "delete" icon)
- Confirmation dialog: "Delete Recipe? Are you sure you want to delete this recipe? This action cannot be undone."
- DELETE mutation with TanStack Query
- Success: navigate back to list with "Recipe deleted successfully!" snackbar
- Error: stay on screen with error snackbar
- Cache invalidation on successful deletion
- testIDs: recipe-detail-delete-button, recipe-detail-delete-dialog-confirm, recipe-detail-delete-dialog-cancel

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Delete button in header (VIEW and EDIT modes)
- ✅ Delete button excluded from CREATE mode
- ✅ Confirmation dialog shown before delete
- ✅ Delete removes recipe via API (DELETE /api/Recipe/:id)
- ✅ Navigates back to list after successful delete
- ✅ Error handling prevents navigation on failure
- ✅ Snackbar feedback for success/error
- ✅ Recipe list cache invalidated on success
- ✅ Old AddRecipeScreen removed (completed in Story 9)
- ✅ All tests pass (110/110)
- ✅ No references to AddRecipeScreen remain (verified)

### Story 12: Optimistic Updates with TanStack Query (SPLIT INTO 12a, 12b, 12c)

**⚠️ This story has been split into three phased implementations for better risk management and incremental delivery. See Stories 12a, 12b, and 12c below.**

---

### Story 12a: Optimistic Delete with Rollback
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority:** HIGH
**Type:** UX Enhancement
**Dependencies:** Story 11
**Estimated Effort:** Small (5-6 hours)
**Actual Effort:** ~5 hours (TDD implementation)

**2025 Standards Applied:**
✅ Cache Manipulation (multi-location updates)
✅ Manual Rollback + Refetch (fast + consistent)
✅ Retry Actions (user-friendly errors)
✅ Query Cancellation (concurrent handling)

**User Story:**
As a user, I want deleted recipes to disappear instantly so the app feels responsive, with automatic rollback if the deletion fails.

**Why Start Here?**
- ✅ Simplest optimistic update (no temp IDs, no navigation concerns)
- ✅ Delete mutation already exists in RecipeListScreen
- ✅ Validates the optimistic pattern before tackling complex scenarios
- ✅ Immediate UX improvement with low risk

**Current Behavior:**
Delete: Confirm → Wait → Snackbar → List refetches

**Target Behavior:**
Delete: Confirm → **Instantly disappears** → API deletes in background → Success/Rollback

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [x] Create `FoodBudgetMobileApp/src/hooks/` directory
- [x] Create `hooks/useRecipeMutations.ts` with optimistic delete
- [x] Migrate delete mutation from RecipeListScreen to hook
- [x] Add onMutate to remove from cache immediately
- [x] Add onError with rollback + refetch for consistency
- [x] Add onSuccess with refetch for consistency
- [x] Add retry action to error snackbar
- [x] Write tests in `hooks/__tests__/useRecipeMutations.test.tsx` (11 tests)
- [x] Add RecipeListScreen unit tests (5 tests)
- [x] Add RecipeListScreen integration tests (7 tests)

**Files to Create:**
- `FoodBudgetMobileApp/src/hooks/useRecipeMutations.ts`
- `FoodBudgetMobileApp/src/hooks/__tests__/useRecipeMutations.test.tsx`

**Files to Modify:**
- `screens/RecipeListScreen.tsx:90-110` - Use new hook instead of inline mutation

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// hooks/useRecipeMutations.ts
import { useMutation, useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { RecipeService } from '../lib/shared/api/recipe.service';
import type { RecipeResponseDto } from '../lib/shared/types/dto';

export const useDeleteRecipe = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: RecipeService.deleteRecipe,
    onMutate: async (recipeId: string) => {
      // Cancel outgoing refetches (handles concurrency)
      await queryClient.cancelQueries({ queryKey: ['recipes'] });

      // Snapshot current state for rollback
      const previousRecipes = queryClient.getQueryData<RecipeResponseDto[]>(['recipes']);

      // Optimistically remove from cache
      queryClient.setQueryData<RecipeResponseDto[]>(['recipes'], (old) =>
        old?.filter(r => r.id !== recipeId) || []
      );

      return { previousRecipes, recipeId };
    },
    onError: (err, recipeId, context) => {
      // Manual rollback (instant)
      if (context?.previousRecipes) {
        queryClient.setQueryData(['recipes'], context.previousRecipes);
      }

      // Refetch for consistency (background)
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['recipes'] });

      // Error snackbar with retry handled by UI
    },
    onSuccess: () => {
      // Success snackbar handled by UI
      // NO invalidate - trust optimistic update
    },
  });
};
```

**Usage in RecipeListScreen:**
```typescript
const deleteMutation = useDeleteRecipe();

const handleDelete = async (recipeId: string) => {
  try {
    await deleteMutation.mutateAsync(recipeId);
    showSnackbar({ message: 'Recipe deleted', type: 'success' });
  } catch (error) {
    showSnackbar({
      message: 'Failed to delete recipe',
      type: 'error',
      action: {
        label: 'Retry',
        onPress: () => handleDelete(recipeId)
      }
    });
  }
};
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Deleted recipe disappears instantly from list
- [x] Failed delete operations rollback cleanly (recipe reappears)
- [x] Background refetch ensures consistency after error
- [x] Success snackbar shown after successful delete
- [x] Error snackbar shown with retry action after failed delete
- [x] No duplicate recipes after rollback
- [x] Tests verify optimistic update and rollback behavior (23 tests)
- [x] Query cancellation prevents race conditions

**Test Results:**
- ✅ 11/11 hook unit tests passing
- ✅ 5/5 RecipeListScreen unit tests passing
- ✅ 7/7 RecipeListScreen integration tests passing
- **Total: 23/23 tests passing (100%)**

### Story 12b: Optimistic Update with Consistency
**Status:** 🔴 NOT STARTED
**Priority:** HIGH
**Type:** UX Enhancement
**Dependencies:** Story 12a
**Estimated Effort:** Medium (7-8 hours)

**2025 Standards Applied:**
✅ Cache Manipulation (multi-location updates)
✅ Manual Rollback + Refetch (fast + consistent)
✅ Retry Actions (user-friendly errors)
✅ Query Cancellation (concurrent handling)

**User Story:**
As a user, I want recipe updates to show instantly in both the detail screen and list so I see my changes immediately.

**Why Second?**
- ✅ Builds on delete pattern from 12a
- ✅ No temp ID complexity (recipe already has real ID)
- ✅ Validates cache consistency between detail and list views
- ✅ Sets up foundation for create (most complex)

**Current Behavior:**
Update: Submit → Wait → Alert → Navigate → List refetches

**Target Behavior:**
Update: Submit → **Instantly updates in list** → API saves in background → Success/Rollback → Navigate

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `useUpdateRecipe` to `hooks/useRecipeMutations.ts`
- [ ] Update both ['recipes'] and ['recipe', id] query keys optimistically
- [ ] Add rollback for both caches on error + refetch
- [ ] Add retry action to error snackbar
- [ ] Block navigation until API confirms (avoid temp state issues)
- [ ] Add loading indicator during background save
- [ ] Add tests for update optimistic flow

**Files to Modify:**
- `hooks/useRecipeMutations.ts` - Add useUpdateRecipe
- `screens/RecipeDetailScreen.tsx` - Use new hook for EDIT mode
- `hooks/__tests__/useRecipeMutations.test.tsx` - Add update tests

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// hooks/useRecipeMutations.ts
export const useUpdateRecipe = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: ({ id, data }: { id: string; data: RecipeUpdateDto }) =>
      RecipeService.updateRecipe(id, data),
    onMutate: async ({ id, data }) => {
      await queryClient.cancelQueries({ queryKey: ['recipes'] });
      await queryClient.cancelQueries({ queryKey: ['recipe', id] });

      const previousRecipes = queryClient.getQueryData<RecipeResponseDto[]>(['recipes']);
      const previousRecipe = queryClient.getQueryData<RecipeResponseDto>(['recipe', id]);

      // Optimistically update in list
      queryClient.setQueryData<RecipeResponseDto[]>(['recipes'], (old) =>
        old?.map(r => r.id === id ? { ...r, ...data } : r) || []
      );

      // Optimistically update in detail
      queryClient.setQueryData<RecipeResponseDto>(['recipe', id], (old) =>
        old ? { ...old, ...data } : old
      );

      return { previousRecipes, previousRecipe, id };
    },
    onError: (err, { id }, context) => {
      // Rollback both caches
      if (context?.previousRecipes) {
        queryClient.setQueryData(['recipes'], context.previousRecipes);
      }
      if (context?.previousRecipe) {
        queryClient.setQueryData(['recipe', id], context.previousRecipe);
      }

      // Refetch for consistency
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['recipes'] });
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['recipe', id] });
    },
    onSuccess: (updatedRecipe, { id }) => {
      // Replace optimistic data with server response
      queryClient.setQueryData(['recipes'], (old: RecipeResponseDto[] | undefined) =>
        old?.map(r => r.id === id ? updatedRecipe : r) || []
      );
      queryClient.setQueryData(['recipe', id], updatedRecipe);
    },
  });
};
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Updated recipe reflects changes immediately in list
- [ ] Updated recipe reflects changes immediately in detail screen
- [ ] Failed updates rollback cleanly in both locations
- [ ] Background refetch ensures consistency after error
- [ ] Navigation blocked until API confirms update
- [ ] Loading indicator shown during background save
- [ ] Error snackbar with retry action shown for failures
- [ ] List and detail stay consistent
- [ ] Tests verify multi-cache update and rollback

### Story 12c: Optimistic Create with UUID Temp IDs
**Status:** 🔴 NOT STARTED
**Priority:** HIGH
**Type:** UX Enhancement
**Dependencies:** Story 12b
**Estimated Effort:** Large (9-10 hours)

**2025 Standards Applied:**
✅ Cache Manipulation (multi-location updates)
✅ Manual Rollback + Refetch (fast + consistent)
✅ Retry Actions (user-friendly errors)
✅ UUID Temp IDs (expo-crypto for uniqueness)
✅ Query Cancellation (concurrent handling)

**User Story:**
As a user, I want newly created recipes to appear instantly in the list so I see my recipe immediately while it saves.

**Why Last?**
- ⚠️ Most complex (temp ID → real ID replacement)
- ⚠️ Navigation concerns (can't navigate to detail with temp ID)
- ⚠️ Requires lessons learned from 12a and 12b
- ✅ Completes the optimistic update story

**Current Behavior:**
Create: Submit → Wait → Alert → Navigate → List refetches

**Target Behavior:**
Create: Submit → **Instantly appears in list** → Navigate to detail → API saves in background → Replace temp ID

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `useCreateRecipe` to `hooks/useRecipeMutations.ts`
- [ ] Generate temp ID using `expo-crypto`: `temp-${Crypto.randomUUID()}`
- [ ] Add recipe to cache with temp ID and timestamp
- [ ] Sort list by createdAt (new recipe appears at top)
- [ ] Block navigation until real ID received
- [ ] Replace temp ID with real ID on success + refetch on error
- [ ] Remove temp recipe on error
- [ ] Add retry action to error snackbar
- [ ] Show inline loading indicator on temp recipe card
- [ ] Add tests for create optimistic flow with temp ID

**Files to Modify:**
- `hooks/useRecipeMutations.ts` - Add useCreateRecipe
- `screens/RecipeDetailScreen.tsx` - Use new hook for CREATE mode
- `components/shared/recipe/RecipeCard.tsx` - Add loading state for temp IDs
- `hooks/__tests__/useRecipeMutations.test.tsx` - Add create tests

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// hooks/useRecipeMutations.ts
import * as Crypto from 'expo-crypto';

export const useCreateRecipe = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: RecipeService.createRecipe,
    onMutate: async (newRecipe: RecipeCreateDto) => {
      await queryClient.cancelQueries({ queryKey: ['recipes'] });

      const previousRecipes = queryClient.getQueryData<RecipeResponseDto[]>(['recipes']);

      // Create optimistic recipe with UUID temp ID
      const optimisticRecipe: RecipeResponseDto = {
        ...newRecipe,
        id: `temp-${Crypto.randomUUID()}`, // ✅ Proper UUID
        createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
        updatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
        userId: 'temp-user',
      };

      // Add to top of list
      queryClient.setQueryData<RecipeResponseDto[]>(['recipes'], (old) =>
        [optimisticRecipe, ...(old || [])]
      );

      return { previousRecipes, tempId: optimisticRecipe.id };
    },
    onError: (err, variables, context) => {
      // Rollback to previous state
      if (context?.previousRecipes) {
        queryClient.setQueryData(['recipes'], context.previousRecipes);
      }

      // Refetch for consistency
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['recipes'] });
    },
    onSuccess: (createdRecipe, variables, context) => {
      // Replace temp ID with real ID
      queryClient.setQueryData<RecipeResponseDto[]>(['recipes'], (old) =>
        old?.map(r => r.id === context?.tempId ? createdRecipe : r) || []
      );

      // Add to detail cache
      queryClient.setQueryData(['recipe', createdRecipe.id], createdRecipe);
    },
  });
};
```

**RecipeCard Loading Indicator:**
```typescript
// RecipeCard.tsx
const isTempRecipe = recipe.id.startsWith('temp-');

return (
  <Card>
    {isTempRecipe && (
      <View style={styles.savingBadge}>
        <ActivityIndicator size="small" />
        <Text>Saving...</Text>
      </View>
    )}
    {/* Rest of card */}
  </Card>
);
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] New recipe appears instantly at top of list with temp UUID
- [ ] Temp recipe shows loading indicator
- [ ] Navigation blocked until real ID received
- [ ] Temp ID replaced with real ID after success
- [ ] Failed creates remove temp recipe from list with refetch
- [ ] Error snackbar with retry action shown for failures
- [ ] No duplicate entries after temp ID replacement
- [ ] Tests verify temp UUID lifecycle

### Story 12.5: Error Boundary & Offline Detection
**Status:** 🔴 NOT STARTED
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Type:** Reliability & UX
**Dependencies:** Story 11
**Estimated Effort:** Small (4-5 hours)

**User Story:**
As a user, I want the app to handle errors gracefully and inform me when I'm offline, so I don't see blank screens or confusing error messages.

**Why Critical for 2025 Production:**
- **Error Boundary:** Industry standard since React 16 (2017), expected in all production React apps
- **Offline Detection:** PWAs and modern apps detect offline state as baseline UX in 2025
- **Demo Risk:** Component errors during demo show white screen without recovery
- **Professional Standard:** Proper error handling is non-negotiable for portfolio presentation

**Current Gaps:**
- No ErrorBoundary component - crashes show white screen of death
- No offline detection in FetchClient - retries happen even without network
- Poor UX during network failures - no user feedback

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Create ErrorBoundary component with getDerivedStateFromError
- [ ] Create ErrorFallbackScreen with "Try Again" button
- [ ] Wrap App root with ErrorBoundary
- [ ] Add navigator.onLine check to FetchClient before retries
- [ ] Improve offline error messages for users
- [ ] Optional: Create OfflineBanner component
- [ ] Unit tests for ErrorBoundary (error catching, reset)
- [ ] Integration tests for offline detection

**Files to Create:**
- `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - Class component with error catching
- `src/screens/ErrorFallbackScreen.tsx` - User-friendly error display with retry
- `src/components/__tests__/ErrorBoundary.test.tsx` - Error boundary tests
- Optional: `src/components/OfflineBanner.tsx` - Banner for offline state

**Files to Modify:**
- `App.tsx` - Wrap root component with ErrorBoundary
- `src/lib/shared/api/fetch-client.ts:36` - Add navigator.onLine check before retry loop

**Technical Notes:**
```tsx
// ErrorBoundary.tsx (class component required for error boundaries)
export class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component<Props, State> {
  state = { hasError: false, error: null };

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error: Error) {
    return { hasError: true, error };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error: Error, info: React.ErrorInfo) {
    console.error('React Error Boundary caught:', error, info);
    // Future Sprint 5: Send to Sentry or Application Insights
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <ErrorFallbackScreen onReset={() => this.setState({ hasError: false })} />;
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}

// fetch-client.ts - Add before retry loop (line 36)
if (!navigator.onLine) {
  throw new Error('No network connection. Please check your internet and try again.');
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] ErrorBoundary wraps app root in App.tsx
- [ ] Component errors caught by ErrorBoundary (no white screen)
- [ ] ErrorFallbackScreen shows with user-friendly message
- [ ] "Try Again" button resets error state and re-renders app
- [ ] FetchClient checks navigator.onLine before making requests
- [ ] User-friendly "No network connection" error message shown when offline
- [ ] No API retries attempted when offline (saves battery/bandwidth)
- [ ] ErrorBoundary unit tests pass (5+ tests)
- [ ] Offline detection integration tests pass

**Why This Belongs in Sprint 3:**
- Demo blocker: Prevents embarrassing crashes during portfolio presentation
- Quick win: 4-5 hours for significant UX improvement
- Foundation: Sets up error handling patterns for Sprint 4 auth errors

### Story 12.6: Demo API Protection (Optional)
**Status:** 🔴 NOT STARTED
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Type:** Security & Infrastructure
**Dependencies:** Story 12.5
**Estimated Effort:** Small (2-3 hours)

**User Story:**
As the API owner, I want to protect the demo API from abuse so it remains available for portfolio viewers and doesn't incur unexpected Azure costs.

**Why Needed for 2025 Production:**
- **Rate Limiting:** Public APIs without rate limiting are targets for abuse
- **CORS Restriction:** `AllowAnyOrigin()` is a security vulnerability flagged by scanners
- **Cost Control:** Prevents demo API from being overwhelmed and incurring Azure overages
- **Professional Standard:** Shows understanding of production API protection

**Current Gaps:**
- No rate limiting middleware in backend
- CORS set to `AllowAnyOrigin()` (accepts requests from any domain)
- Public demo URL is unprotected

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Add AspNetCoreRateLimit NuGet package
- [ ] Configure in-memory rate limiting (100 req/min per IP)
- [ ] Add rate limiting middleware to pipeline
- [ ] Update appsettings.json with AllowedOrigins
- [ ] Restrict CORS to demo origin + localhost
- [ ] Add logging for rate limit violations
- [ ] Test rate limiting with rapid requests

**Files to Create:**
- None (uses AspNetCoreRateLimit library)

**Files to Modify:**
- `FoodBudgetAPI/FoodBudgetAPI.csproj` - Add AspNetCoreRateLimit package
- `FoodBudgetAPI/Utility/Setup/ServiceConfiguration.cs` - Register rate limiting services
- `FoodBudgetAPI/Utility/Setup/ApplicationConfiguration.cs:22` - Add middleware after logging
- `FoodBudgetAPI/appsettings.json` - Add AllowedOrigins configuration
- `FoodBudgetAPI/Utility/Setup/ServiceConfiguration.cs:86-89` - Restrict CORS origins

**Technical Notes:**
```csharp
// ServiceConfiguration.cs - Add rate limiting registration
services.AddInMemoryRateLimiting();
services.Configure<IpRateLimitOptions>(options =>
{
    options.GeneralRules = new List<RateLimitRule>
    {
        new() { Endpoint = "*", Period = "1m", Limit = 100 }
    };
});

// ApplicationConfiguration.cs - Add middleware (after logging, line 22)
app.UseIpRateLimiting();

// appsettings.json - Add allowed origins
"AllowedOrigins": "https://cadil91.github.io,http://localhost:8081"

// ServiceConfiguration.cs - Restrict CORS (replace AllowAnyOrigin)
var allowedOrigins = builder.Configuration.GetValue<string>("AllowedOrigins")
    ?.Split(',') ?? Array.Empty<string>();

policy.WithOrigins(allowedOrigins)
    .AllowAnyMethod()
    .AllowAnyHeader();
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled (100 requests/minute per IP)
- [ ] 429 Too Many Requests returned when limit exceeded
- [ ] Rate limit violations logged with IP address
- [ ] CORS restricted to GitHub Pages demo URL + localhost
- [ ] CORS preflight requests work correctly
- [ ] Demo app still functions with restricted CORS
- [ ] Rate limiting doesn't affect normal demo usage

**Why This is Optional for Sprint 3:**
- Not a demo blocker (nice-to-have)
- Quick security win before public launch
- Can be added after initial demo if time is tight
